# smart-reveal

Manipulate DOM elements based on scroll thresholds.

*Honestly, this probably exists I just couldn't find it anywhere else.*

## Dependencies

jQuery

## How to

### Download

The easiest way is to use npm and browserify.

```
npm install smart-reveal
```

Or you can [download the latest release](https://github.com/LegitTalon/smart-reveal/releases)
and add it to the page via `<script>` tags or something.

### Use

```javascript
// If using this without Browserify ignore this line.
var SmartReveal = require('smart-reveal');

// Instantiate with any DOM element by passing a jQuery valid selector.
var nav = new SmartReveal('#nav');

// Then initialize with the `.smartReveal` method
nav.smartReveal();
```

### Options

Pass an object as the second parameter upon instantiating. Here is an example
with all the default options explained.

```javascript
var nav = new SmartReveal('#nav', {
  // How many pixels up to scroll before triggering `transitionIn`
  thresholdUp: 50,

  // How many pixels down to scroll before triggering `transitionOut`
  thresholdDown: 50,

  // Called when the `thresholdUp` value is broken.
  // I recommend using CSS animations instead of the defaults for pizzazz.
  transitionIn: function($el) {
    $el.show(300);
  },

  // Called when the `thresholdDown` value is broken.
  // I recommend using CSS animations instead of the defaults for pizzazz.
  transitionOut: function($el) {
    $el.hide(300);
  },

  // The miliseconds to wait before deciding the user is done scrolling.
  scrollTimeout: 250
});

```
