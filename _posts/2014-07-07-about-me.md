## About me
Hello there internet stranger. You have entered my domain. I have _let_ you into my public abode and now you will suffer by listening to my words.

I am just a human doing what any reasonable human does. I eat, I sleep and I listen to better music than you do.

I write code for fun and profit and it's one of my feverish passions. I enjoy it immensely.

I have opinions that I don't like to share but maybe I will start sharing them because now I have a neat blog.

## About this Blog
This was a forray into Jekyll and I have enjoyed it thus far. Static files are fast, because they are not dynamically generated so they require only the time it takes to retrieve them from the server in order to load. Jekyll lets you scaffold out your basic website using the [Liquid Templating Engine](http://liquidmarkup.org/) and [YAML](http://yaml.org/) in a very clean and enjoyable fashion. I think jekyll thrives in its unobtrusive simplicity. It is easy to build a blog such as this with very little effort, but more complex sites can also be constructed by integrating whatever web techonology interests you.

This blog is for now hosted using [GitHub](http://github.com/legittalon/legittalon.github.io) and I've been using [prose.io](http://prose.io) to edit the pages and posts. It's neat but could be better. I might take on a personal project to tackle some ideas I've had about Jekyll and CMS.

See you around.
